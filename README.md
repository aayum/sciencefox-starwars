Description
This is a two screen app that deals with star war characters and their details.
First screen includes serach bar. When a query is searched , list of star wars characters is displayed on the screen (Characters name ).
When any character is clicked , it loads second screen containing character details like - name , burth year , heght , films and their crawls.


## Design Architecture used :
MVP
Model - view - presenter
Why this - I have handons experience on using MVP


## API calls
API calls to fetch character list and details of films is done using 
### Retrofit and Rx java       


### Recycler view is used to display list of characters         

UI of the app is basic with no fancy things (due to just a demo)

Ensured code quality 
Used meaningful variables and method naming convention to justify the purpose of them.
Defined smaller functions to maintain cleaner code and code readability.
No warning in the code.


### Improvements (there is always a scope for )
MVVM can be ued along with live data
Coroutines can be used 

For both of the above , I have basic knowledge.
